# **Description:**
	- The Decorator allows you to modify an object dynamically (at runtime).
	- Simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes
    - Rather than rewrite old code you can extend with new code.
    - It is more flexible than inheritance
    - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a
    flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
	
# **When to use:**
    - You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you
    need to add functionality at run time.
    - When you want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time. Inheritance is not
    feasible because it is static and applies to an entire class.
