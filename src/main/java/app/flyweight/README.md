# **Description:**
	- Uses caching (HashTable/HashMap) to avoid creation of similar objects that were already created
	- Reduces the memory usage
	- Although creating an object in Java is really fast, we can still reduce the execution time of our program by sharing objects.
# **When to use:**
    - used when you need to create a large number of similar objects
